Even though nobody asked, here is a complete list of all the technology I own and use. Find out what other developers
are using on this very [cool website by Wes Bos - Uses Tech](https://uses.tech/). It actually inspired me to write
this article and seemed to be a good start for writing articles cause I dont have to think alot for this one.

#### 5. Samsung S7 FE

I really love this tablet but 4GB RAM is brutal, still more than enough for my use case. Mostly, I read comics
on its massive 13inch display and watch YouTube videos at might. Its speakers are also top notch, some nights
I just play music on the tablet and their audio quality is comparable to my home theatre. Other than that, its
great for drawing, even though I do not draw at the moment but in future I want to explore drawing.

2. Expanded Storage - 256GB
3. RAM - 4GB

#### 6. PlayStation 5

I also have a PS4, and I mostly buy PS4 games yet because they all work great with PS5 too. Here is my collection
of games. I also own The Last of Us Part II Collector's Edition. I love that game!

#### 7. Camera

I am so impressed by the video quality of this camera. It's price is close to Sony A6100 and in my opinion, records
video better than A6600 which is double the price. I wasn't surprised though, since ZVE10 is not even a year old at
this point while A6600 is more than 3 years old.
